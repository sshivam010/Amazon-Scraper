Hello,

I have extracted information like name, price, rating, review count and availabililty of books on amazon , using BeautifulSoup and Requests library. The code will only extract information about books because I have hardcode the url(Result page when you search 'Books' on Amazon) , due to complexity issues. I did not know how to create an application so I have just written the script which performs the data extraction . Hence I was not able to solve all the problems mentioned in the assignment document. But I promise you I can and I will learn how to do so if given the oppurtunity. Currently the code only extracts information about books on the 1st result page but code can be easily modified to crawl to next result pages. I have also attached the output file. Hoping you will consider my submission.

Thank you.
