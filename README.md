# Amazon-Scraper
Scrapes information like Product Name, Price, Rating , Review Counts, Availability, etc from amazon.

Usage :  

`python amazon.py`

I have extracted information like name, price, rating, review count and availabililty of books on amazon , using BeautifulSoup and Requests library.  
The code will extract information about books because I have hardcoded the url(Result page when you search 'Books' on Amazon).  

Currently the code only extracts information about books on the 1st result page but code can be easily modified to crawl to next result pages.   
I have also attached the output file.
